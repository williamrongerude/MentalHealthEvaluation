How to develop a supervised classification model with public data.

Inspired by my own project, which classifies depression risk using a variety of features from survey data.

This repository is under the assumption that the StormAnalysis repository was read, and/or you are familiar with developing machine learning pipelines. We will focus on what's unique to classification tasks, such as making binary predictions, understanding new metrics and matrix evaluation techniques, and the larger set of implications when trying to predict something where accuracy is vital.
